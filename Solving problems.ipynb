    "A problem is an innocuous or undesirable situation that requires attention to be solved. Problems are ubiquitous and they materialize differently with every circumstance. An essential epiphany everyone needs to have is that problems are a part of life. We connect more with the world when we solve problems we encounter. \n",

    "Data scientists are expected to assist in the decision making process in organizations with the help of data. The path to becoming a professional data scientist is paved with problems. For example, at the beginning this semester, I was asked to solve a problem of any kind with data. This task was not very difficult for me because I have a lot of questions about data science and the world. The problem however, was answering the question with data. Today, data is collected in a plethora of ways - surveys and IoT to name a few but sometimes, the data required to a test a certain hypothesis is unavailable. People approach problems in a variety of ways - some people get overwhelmed, some give up and others tackle the problem.\n",

This piece elaborates how I solved an entry level software engineering problem. Note-worthy is the fact this approach is very transferable and does not apply to just software engineering.\n"

    "- Negative amounts may be indicated either by a negative sign before the currency symbol or by enclosing the amount (including currency symbol) in parenthesis, such as ($450).\n",
    "- Dollar and Euro amounts may contain an amount of cents, represented to exactly two digits of precision.\n",
    "- If a decimal point is present, the cents must be specified.\n",

    "The first step to solving any problem is understanding the problem. The Pareto principle, which is named after the renowned economist Vilfredo Pareto states that 20% of causes birth 80% of consequences accentuating an uneven relationship between inputs and outputs <i>(Investopedia, 2019)</i>. This principle can also be applied to a problem-solving process - understanding a problem <b>(20%)</b> solves <b>80%</b> of problem. Thus this step is very important."

Time spent during this phase varies for everyone. Some people have to read it once to fully understand whereas others like me have to read it multiple times.

Any string that does not satisfy these constraints is an invalid string. I also noticed that if I could somehow get the digit from the string for eg. $450$ from <code>$450</code>, I'll easily be able to tell if it is well-formatted or not."
